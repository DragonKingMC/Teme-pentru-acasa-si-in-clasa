Christmas & It’s Eve

On the Christmas Eve, me and my parents went to my grandparents and my aunts and cousins. We laughed and we celebrated the coming Christmas. We really had a good time. 
On our way home, we went shopping to buy ingredients for bread and more traditional delicacies.
When we got home, my other grandma was waiting us so we can make all types of foods together.  I helped her with the cookies.
After that, we set up the tree and decorated it. Iw was so much fun!
When it became night outside, I went to sleep. Next day, I woke up remembering it’s Christmas. I went to the Christmas Tree and at the bottom I found a big history book,  a lots of candy… like A LOT and a harmonica. Yea, I really didn’t know what to ask Santa to bring me…


New Year’s Eve

On New Year’s Eve, my parents invited some of their friends at our home and their sons came too. We played outside until night came and then we stood with our parents in my apartment. We were feeling great. We were telling jokes and playing on my PC.
After that, we got the food and the drinks ready. 
When the clock hit 00:00 we toasted with the champagne and we went outside to watch the fireworks from the nearby blocks.
It was a lot of fun! Did you had fun too with your family? Tell me! 
